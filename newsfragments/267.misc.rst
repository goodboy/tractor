This (finally) adds fully acknowledged remote cancellation messaging
support for both explicit ``Portal.cancel_actor()`` calls as well as
when there is a "runtime-wide" cancellations (eg. during KBI or general
actor nursery exception handling which causes a full actor
"crash"/termination).

You can think of this as the most ideal case in 2-generals where the
actor requesting the cancel of its child is able to always receive back
the ACK to that request. This leads to a more deterministic shutdown of
the child where the parent is able to wait for the child to fully
respond to the request. On a localhost setup, where the parent can
monitor the state of the child through process or other OS APIs instead
of solely through IPC messaging, the parent can know whether or not the
child decided to cancel with more certainty. In the case of separate
hosts, we still rely on a simple timeout approach until such a time
where we prefer to get "fancier".
