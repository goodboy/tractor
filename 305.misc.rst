Add ``tractor.query_actor()`` an addr looker-upper which doesn't deliver
a ``Portal`` instance and instead just a socket address ``tuple``.

Sometimes it's handy to just have a simple way to figure out if
a "service" actor is up, so add this discovery helper for that. We'll
prolly just leave it undocumented for now until we figure out
a longer-term/better discovery system.
