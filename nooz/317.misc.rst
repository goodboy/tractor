Drop use of the ``msgpack`` package and instead move fully to the
``msgspec`` codec library.

We've now used ``msgspec`` extensively in production and there's no
reason to not use it as default. Further this change preps us for the up
and coming typed messaging semantics (#196), dialog-unprotocol system
(#297), and caps-based messaging-protocols (#299) planned before our
first beta.
