Fix keyboard interrupt handling in ``Portal.open_context()`` blocks.

Previously this not triggering cancellation of the remote task context
and could result in hangs if a stream was also opened. This fix is to
accept `BaseException` since it is likely any other top level exception
other then kbi (even though not expected) should also get this result.
