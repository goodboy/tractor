Add a custom 'CANCEL' log level and use through runtime.

In order to reduce log messages and also start toying with the idea of
"application layer" oriented tracing, we added this new level just above
'runtime' but just below 'info'. It is intended to be used solely for
cancellation and teardown related messages. Included are some small
overrides to the stdlib's ``logging.LoggerAdapter`` to passthrough the
correct stack frame to show when one of the custom level methods is
used.
